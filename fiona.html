    <h2>Hurricane Fiona Recovery Efforts</h2>
    <div class="recovery">
        <p class = recovery-L>The federal government says it'll pay 100% of Puerto Rico's recovery costs from Hurricane Fiona for the next month, and President Biden says his administration is laser focused on helping the people on the island. Five days after Fiona made landfall, more than a million people are still without power, and hundreds of thousands lack running water. </p>

    <h2>Hurricane Damages</h2>
    <div class = "Ian">
        
        <div class = "facts">
            <p>The outage has forced businesses including grocery stores and gas stations to temporarily close and prevented hundreds of schools from opening. In addition, 16 government medical clinics and seven dialysis centers are still operating on generators.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "facts">
            <p>In a policy brief released Thursday, the Puerto Rico-based think tank Center for a New Economy said Puerto Rico already was extremely vulnerable prior to Fiona because only 30% of permanent reconstruction work related to 2017â€²s Hurricane Maria had started.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "facts">
            <p>The lack of power has led to dwindling diesel supplies and prompted U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to announce Wednesday night that he would temporarily waive a federal law to allow for a British Petroleum ship to dock in Puerto Rico and unload 300,000 barrels of diesel.</p>
